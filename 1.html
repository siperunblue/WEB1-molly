    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5" target="_blank" title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
    <p>A web browser would typically receive HTML documents from either a web server or local storage. These documents are then rendered into multimedia web pages by the browser for viewing by a user and as such; one can say that these documents basically make up the structure of a web page semantically and originally, cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>Through the use of HTML elements, a web page can consist of various different entities ranging from images to interactive web forms. This is accomplished by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and etc. These elements are identified by tags; angled brackets surrounding the keyword.</p>
